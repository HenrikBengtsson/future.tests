## Contributions

This Git repository uses the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model (the [`git flow`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) extension is useful for this).  The [`develop`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.tests/tree/develop) branch contains the latest contributions and other code that will appear in the next release, and the [`master`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.tests) branch contains the code of the latest release.

Contributing to this package is easy.  Just send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  When you send your PR, make sure `develop` is the destination branch on the [future.tests repository](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.tests).  Your PR should pass `R CMD check --as-cran`, which will also be checked by  and  when the PR is submitted.
